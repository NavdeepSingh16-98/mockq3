Execution context is an internal data structure used by JavaScript to manage the execution of code. It keeps track of the variables, functions, and other contextual information during the execution of a program. Each time a function is invoked or a block of code is executed, a new execution context is created.

The execution context can be conceptualized as a container that holds three main components:

1. Variable Environment: It stores all the variables declared within the current scope. This includes function arguments, local variables, and function declarations. The variable environment also contains references to the outer environment (i.e., the variables in the parent scope) to support lexical scoping.

2. Scope Chain: It represents the hierarchical structure of variable environments. It is used to resolve variable references during the execution of code. The scope chain allows accessing variables in the current scope and its parent scopes up to the global scope.

3. This Value: It refers to the value of the `this` keyword within the current execution context. The `this` value is determined based on how a function is called (e.g., as a method, standalone function, constructor function, etc.).

To illustrate the concept, here's a diagram showing the relationship between execution contexts:

```
                             +-------------------+
                             | Global Execution |
                             |    Context        |
                             +-------------------+
                                      |
                                      |
                       +---------------------------+
                       |                           |
        +-------------------------+    +-------------------------+
        |   Function Execution    |    |   Function Execution    |
        |        Context          |    |        Context          |
        +-------------------------+    +-------------------------+
```

In the diagram, the top-level is the Global Execution Context, which represents the initial scope when the script is loaded. It contains global variables and function declarations.

When a function is called, a new Function Execution Context is created and added to the stack. If multiple functions are called, each will have its own execution context, forming a stack known as the Call Stack.

The most recently added execution context is the currently executing context, and its variables and functions are accessible. Once a function completes its execution, its execution context is removed from the stack, and the control is returned to the previous context.

The execution context concept helps JavaScript manage variable scope, maintain context-specific data, and ensure the correct resolution of variables and functions during runtime.

It's important to note that the diagram represents a simplified view of execution contexts, and there are additional internal components and optimizations performed by JavaScript engines that are not shown here.
